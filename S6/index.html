		    <h2>FKJ Mesmerizes In Front Of Priceless Painting At Paris Modern Art Museum </h2>
		    <p>FKJ–short for French Kiwi Juice–is a multi-talented one-man band whose output is consistently riveting. The Tours, France native utilizes the most potent elements of a vast spectrum of styles to craft his “expanding grooves.” FKJ is a wonder to watch. He creates all the moving parts–the smooth guitar licks, the synths, the sax, the jazz-blues bass lines–and sets them loose as hip-hop beat loops and introspective jazz tangents, juggling the mounting melodies with effortless flow.</p>
